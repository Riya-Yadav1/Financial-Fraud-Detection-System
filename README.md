# Financial-Fraud-Detection-System
The project successfully leveraged a combination of data preprocessing, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and advanced analytical techniques to build a robust framework for identifying fraudulent transactions.
The project began with the acquisition and rigorous preprocessing of the "Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023" from Kaggle. This involved data cleaning, inspection, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling. Subsequently, a suite of machine learning models was developed and evaluated. Supervised models, particularly ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost, demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving accuracy levels exceeding 99% on the balanced dataset.
In addition to supervised learning, unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, including Isolation Forest and a PCA-based reconstruction error model, were successfully implemented. These models provide a valuable secondary line of defense for identifying novel or unusual fraud patterns not seen in labeled training data. A conceptual demonstration of graph-based analysis was also conducted, showcasing how network relationships can be used to detect sophisticated fraud rings by creating and analyzing a synthetic transactional graph.
